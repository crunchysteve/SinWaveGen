## SineWaveGen

SinWaveGen is a synchronised sinewave generator that takes a
square input on an Arduino Uno, Nano, etc digital pin and
outputs a loosely synchronised sinusoid wave as opposite
polarity PWM signals on pins 5 (+ve) and 6 (-ve).

It's intended to test the timings and reliability when
generating a sychronised sinewave at frequencies equal to
the first 2 octaves of a bass guitar and whether it's feasable
as a tone generator for the Dan the Bass Man guitar pedal. 
It would probably be used in conjunction with an analog VCA
and Attack/Decay circuit as I'm not sure at this stage if it
has the bandwidth to do that digitally, without writing the
sketch entirely in assembly code.

(ToDo:  turn off output when input timing is null)
